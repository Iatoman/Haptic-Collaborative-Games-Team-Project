All attended the lab space to verify that our work-in-progress connects with the device.

Using Tianfeng's demo, our device pointer object has haptic functionality and force
feedback with the static board and obstacles using the BULLET engine. 

Tianfeng's demo also showed a working grid system in the game that could work with the A* algorithm.

Further work was done regarding our new plan to import a custom object.
If we move the new board too fast the ball will just phase through and fall
This problem is to be worked on, but if this isn't solved there exists a backup plan.

Next meeting 5th April in the lab or on teams
