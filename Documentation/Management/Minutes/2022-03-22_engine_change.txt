Progress has been made with linking an object with physical properties to the board
unfortunately the absense of an addChild function for ODE makes it difficult to construct a board in the way we want it

After investigation we found out that the BULLET physics engine provides an addChild function that looks like it would
behave in the way we want it to. 

We may have to take everything we constructed with ODE and convert it to BULLET.

Work continues on the A* algorithm and splitting up classes.
