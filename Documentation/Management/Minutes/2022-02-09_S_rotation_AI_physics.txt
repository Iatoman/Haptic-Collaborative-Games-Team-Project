final refactoring of class diagram before supervisor meeting

Discussing the question of how to get the board to rotate, none of the functions appear to be changing anything in the demo program

use ODE
to implement object interactions (collisions) 
so we can compute collisions automatically instead of simulating it ourselves

paper perhaps suggests a framework for enabling haptic interactions in a game

use a potential field algorithm to compute local routes with collisions against obstacles
possibly A star algorithm?
