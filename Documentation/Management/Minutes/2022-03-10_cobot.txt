went to lab after getting news of issues with device being fixed

DEVICE FIXED
We were missing a Virtuose.cfg config file in the ODE/bin/lin-x86_64 folder
Device now works with ODE examples in the original chai3d folder (not git repo)

NEW PROBLEM
From what we can tell no method exists that replicates the behaviour of addChild() but with ODE collisions added
