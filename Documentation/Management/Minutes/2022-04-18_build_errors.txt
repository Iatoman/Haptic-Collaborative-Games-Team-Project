Discussed syntax errors with all code

people having trouble building the program using the makefile
missing "libchai3d-BULLET.a"
cause & solution:
	gitignore is excluding .a and .o files, have to re-make chai3d and BULLET module
	this must be factored in to the proper makefile

Began planning out report
Work now goes into
	fixing syntax errors in existing code
	beginning the report
