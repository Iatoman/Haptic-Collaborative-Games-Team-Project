game is a tool for reasearch about interactions

use a single class for graphical and haptic elements

the AI class requires an understanding of the world so it can assist

it was suggested that we only control the ball 
	spring based static system to control the ball 
	-read the paper

human control class should be symmetric to the AI class

stretch goal: 
	could have dynamic obstacles that move when hit

prototype:
	implement a scene using one of the designed classes
	(create a world, a board and put a sprite on top that can move around)
