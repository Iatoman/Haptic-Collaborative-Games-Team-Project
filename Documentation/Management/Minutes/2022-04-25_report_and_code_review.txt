Work has started on the main report. 

Went over some problems concerning the code.
	No ball movement using CHAI3D's built in force application functions.
	currently unable to get the ball to move.
	
Remaining tasks:
	code:
		move ball by applying force
		end the game when ball reaches a goal
		
		make the ball respond to mouse movement
			ball always tries to move towards mouse position
				the further the ball is from the mouse, the greater the force
		make the ball respond to movement from the device in the same way.
			the further the ball is from the haptic cursor, the greater the force

		Add 'addInvisibleWalls' and 'removeInvisibleWalls' to Board.cpp
		
		
		Do not spawn objects or start timer until 'start' is pressed
	
	
		Add comprehensive comments to all code
	
	report:
		write report..
		

Tasks:
	Salaar: invisible walls
	Daniel + Lok: report writing
	Tianfeng + Jiahao: mouse + haptic + ball movement
	Ibrahim: start screen + something from trello
