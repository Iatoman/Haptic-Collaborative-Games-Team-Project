We have been following the requirements wrong for the majority of this project.
There is one month left, there is a mountain of work to be done

We are to deliver a haptic board game framework/API that allows for easy creation
of different board games. What we produce should be comprehensible and well documented.



We are abandoning board rotation and are planning to implement movement of the ball
on a static board. This allows for objects to be placed and have perfect collisions,
thus solving the problems we've been having for weeks.
