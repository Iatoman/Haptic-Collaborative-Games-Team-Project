the addChild() method will only add the mesh to the board and not the physical object.

Solutions:

new idea
use google sketchup to create a board and import 3ds file

possible fix for our board collision problem
not sure how to make a coordinate system work with this

if that fails there is a backup plan where death zones are used instead of obstacles

next meeting monday 12pm
